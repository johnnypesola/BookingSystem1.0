### Booking system

This is a booking system that was explicitly made for the course 1DV430 on Linnaeus University in the spring term of 2015.  
   
At it's current state it's only possible to make location based bookings. But later versions of it will 
contain alot more functionality, like resource booking and such.    
   
The system itself contains a frontend written in AngularJS (v1.2.28) and a backend written in Asp.NET (Web Api 2). Microsoft SQL 2008 R2 is used as database.
   
More specific documentation is available in the wiki in Swedish (Sorry about that).
